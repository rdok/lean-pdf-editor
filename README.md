This project makes simple PDF editing. It bookmarks pages, and removes page ranges.

###### Why

At the time of this writing, current PDF software editors, are either [really expensive $90+](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-pro), or do not provide these features, e.g. [luminpdf](https://www.luminpdf.com/)

This project aims for users who just want to make a simple one of change.
