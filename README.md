# Lean PDF Editor
This project makes simple PDF editing. It removes pag ranges, and adds bookmarks to a page.

###### Why
At the time of this writing, current PDF software editors, are either [really expensive $90+](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-pro), or do not provide these features, e.g. [luminpdf](https://www.luminpdf.com/)

This project aims for users who just want to edit personal PDF, and not in business perspective.
