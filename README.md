# Lean PDF Editor
[![Build](https://github.com/rdok/lean-pdf-editor/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rdok/lean-pdf-editor/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

This project makes simple PDF editing. It removes page ranges, and adds bookmarks to a page.

###### Why
At the time of this writing, current PDF software editors, are either [really expensive $90+](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-pro), or do not provide these features, e.g. [luminpdf](https://www.luminpdf.com/) This project aims for users who just want to make a simple one of change.
